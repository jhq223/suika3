## Linux (Wayland/X11 Dual)

### Prerequisites

* A `Linux` machine with any processor

On Debian, Ubuntu, or Raspberry Pi OS:
```
sudo apt-get install git cmake ninja-build build-essential libasound2-dev libx11-dev libxpm-dev libwayland-dev wayland-protocols libegl1-mesa-dev libegl-dev libgles-dev libwayland-client0 libwayland-egl1 libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-x libdecor-0-dev
```

On RedHat, Rocky Linux, Fedora, etc.:
```
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools" "Development Libraries"
sudo dnf install patch git cmake ninja-build alsa-lib-devel libX11-devel libXpm-devel wayland-devel wayland-protocols-devel mesa-libEGL-devel alsa-lib-devel gstreamer1.0-devel gstreamer1.0-plugins-base-devel libdecor-devel
```

### Steps

Open the terminal and type the following.
```
git clone https://github.com/suika3-community/suika3.git
cd suika3
cmake --preset linux
cmake --build --preset linux
```

The target file `build-linux/suika3` will be created.

If you want to debug Suika3 with GDB, you can use the `linux-debug` preset instead of `linux`.

```
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools" "Development Libraries"
sudo dnf install patch git cmake ninja-build wayland-devel wayland-protocols-devel mesa-libEGL-devel alsa-lib-devel gstreamer1.0-devel gstreamer1.0-plugins-base-devel libdecor-devel
```

### Steps

Open the terminal and type the following.
```
git clone https://github.com/suika3-community/suika3.git
cd suika3
cmake --preset linux-wayland
cmake --build --preset linux-wayland
```

The target file `build-linux-wayland/suika3` will be created.

If you want to debug Suika3 with GDB, you can use the `linux-wayland-debug` preset instead of `linux-wayland`.

## Windows (Visual Studio 2026)

Visual Studio is the recommended build environment for Windows, and is used for the official binary.

### Prerequisites

* A `Windows 11` PC with an Intel, AMD, or Arm64 processor
* `Visual Studio 2026` installed with C/C++ and CMake configured

### Steps

* Clone the repository.
* Open the root of the source code folder in Visual Studio.
* Wait for the CMake configuration to complete.
* Choose the `VS2026 x64 Release` target.
* Build the project.

The target file `out/build/windows-vs2026-x64-release/suika3.exe` will be created.

---

## Windows (WSL2)

This method uses MinGW on WSL2 to create a Windows exe file.
Note that it is possible to build Suika3 using MinGW,
but it is not recommended due to false positives in antivirus software.

### Prerequisites

* A `Windows 11` PC with an Intel, AMD, or Arm64 processor
* The `WSL2` feature installed
* `Ubuntu` or `Debian` installed on WSL2

```
sudo apt-get install cmake ninja-build mingw-w64
```

### Steps

Open the terminal and type the following.

```
git clone https://github.com/suika3-community/suika3.git
cd suika3
cmake --preset windows-mingw-x86_64
cmake --build --preset windows-mingw-x86_64
```

The target file `build-mingw-x86_64/suika3.exe` will be created.

---

## macOS (App Bundle)

This method creates an app bundle for macOS, and is used for the official binary.

### Prerequisites

* A Mac with an Apple Silicon or Intel processor
* `macOS 11` or later installed
* `Xcode` installed

### Steps

Open the terminal and type the following.

```
git clone https://github.com/suika3-community/suika3.git
cd suika3
cmake --preset macos
cmake --build --preset macos
```

The target `build-macos/Suika3.app` will be created.

### DMG Packaging

If you want to distribute Suika3 for macOS, you need to create a DMG file with code signing and notirization.
You need to have a `Developer ID Application` certificate in the keychain and be logged in with an Apple Developer account on Xcode.
Please note that an app bundle distributed via a zip file cannot access outside of the app bundle, so we use DMG here.

```
cd macos

# Sign the app.
codesign --timestamp --options runtime --entitlements ../resources/macos/macos.entitlements --deep --force --sign "Developer ID Application" Suika3.app

# Notarize the app. (takes some time)
ditto -c -k --sequesterRsrc --keepParent Suika3.app Suika3.zip
xcrun notarytool submit Suika3.zip --apple-id "$APPLE_ID" --team-id "$TEAM_ID" --password "$APP_SECRET" --wait
xcrun stapler staple Suika3.app

# Create a DMG file.
mkdir tmp
cp -Rv Suika3.app tmp/Suika3.app
hdiutil create -fs HFS+ -format UDBZ -srcfolder tmp -volname Suika3 Suika3.dmg

# Sign the DMG file to allow access to files outside the bundle (avoid Gatekeeper issues).
codesign --sign "Developer ID Application" Suika3.dmg
```

---

## macOS (CLI)

This method creates a command-line interface (CLI) version of Suika3 for macOS.
It is useful for debugging and development, but is not recommended for distribution.

### Prerequisites

* A Mac with an Apple Silicon or Intel processor
* `macOS 11` or later installed
* `Xcode` installed

### Steps

Open the terminal and type the following.

```
git clone https://github.com/suika3-community/suika3.git
cd suika3
cmake --preset macos-cli
cmake --build --preset macos-cli
```

The target `build-macos/Suika3.app` will be created.

If you want to debug Suika3 with LLDB, you can use the `macos-cli-debug` preset instead of `macos`.
